In December 1999 , a federal judge blocked a San Francisco ban on ATM surcharges ,
though the voters had approved the measure by a 2-to-1 ratio .
The injunction prevented implementation of the San Francisco ordinance
and prevented Santa Monica from enforcing a similar law .
Also in December 1999 , the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled
that states were not empowered to block the imposition of ATM fees .
The Connecticut Court ruling and an earlier ruling by the Iowa 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals support the banking industry position
that only the federal government can regulate the ATMs of national banks .
