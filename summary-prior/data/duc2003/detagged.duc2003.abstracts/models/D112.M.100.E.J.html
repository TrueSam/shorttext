Since the 1990 launch of the Hubble Space Telescope , several service missions have been flown to repair , replace , or upgrade systems .
In 1993 , astronauts corrected a flaw in the telescope 's optical system .
In 1997 , a shuttle Discovery mission was flown to install a new , powerful infrared camera , an advanced spectrograph , and other electronic equipment .
In November 1999 , the orbiting telescope shut itself down
when four of its six gyroscopes ( used for stability and precision pointing ) became inoperable .
In a December 1999 emergency service mission , a seven-man shuttle crew replaced all six gyroscopes , as well as the Hubble 's central computer .
