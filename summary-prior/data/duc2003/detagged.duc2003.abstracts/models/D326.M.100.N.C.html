In our present-day history of ferry sinkings with 100 or more deaths , two in particular stand out .
The first was the British ferry Herald of Free Enterprise
that capsized off the Belgian port of Zeebrugge in 1987 with the loss of 193 lives .
The second , occurring seven years later ,
was the ferry Estonia
that capsized in the Baltic Sea off the Finnish Island of Uto with the loss of more than 900 lives .
It was traveling from Tallinn , Estonia to Stockholm .
Both were vehicle ' roll-on roll-off ' ferries .
The suspected cause in both was faulty closure or integrity of the bow doors .
