There has been progress in development of automobiles powered by hydrogen
-- either through a fuel cell which produces electricity or as a fuel for rotary engines .
Daimler-Benz has produced a fuel cell vehicle
and predicts by 1996 production of a fuel cell which can fit into a passenger car .
The problem with fuel cells is their limited life span .
Mazda 's HR-X2 concept car has a rotary engine fueled by a hydrogen gas
stored in a fuel tank .
The problem is how to fit enough hydrogen into a tank
and ultimately how to produce enough hydrogen to provide a significant substitution for petroleum .
