The European Economic Community ( EEC )
was established in 1957 .
In 1970 a fully integrated European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) was proposed ,
which lead to a 1995 proposal for a single European currency , the Euro .
European Union ( EU ) countries first linked their current systems to the new future single currency through a new European exchange rate mechanism .
EU then determined which EU nations met established economic standards for conversion .
11 of the 15 EU nations were approved ,
2 opted out 
and 2 were postponed as unqualified .
Those 11 converted to the Euro in January 1999 , with July 2002 the scheduled close-out of their old currency systems .
