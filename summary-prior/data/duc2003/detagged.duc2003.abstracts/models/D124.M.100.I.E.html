The awarding of the Nobel Prize to Doctors Without Borders , also know by their French title Medecins Sans Frontieres ,
met with little criticism .
Even so , the humanitarian organization
founded in 1971 by 10 French doctors has not been without its detractors .
The organization was founded in protest to the neutrality of the Red Cross .
Doctors Without Borders will openly criticize conditions and government policies in countries
where they are working .
This practiced has led them to withdraw from Kosovo
to protest government instituted terror , for example .
They also withdrew from North Korea and Madagascar
following disputers with those governments .
