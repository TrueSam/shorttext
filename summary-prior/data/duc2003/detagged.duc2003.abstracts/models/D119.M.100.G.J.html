In December 1996 , India and Bangladesh signed a 30-year Ganges water-sharing agreement ,
resolving a major irritant in bilateral relations since 1974
when India built a dam near Farakka .
Bangladesh had accused India of releasing excessive water during the monsoon season ,
while diverting much of the water during the dry season .
The accord was made possible
when India agreed to divorce the issue of rail transit through Bangladesh to the landlocked Indian state , Tripura .
Other issues confronting the two nations include , drug smuggling , woman and child trafficking , disputed lands , border violence , and tariff concessions
for Bangladesh to narrow the trade gap .
