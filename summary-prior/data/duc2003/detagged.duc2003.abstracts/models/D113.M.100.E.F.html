President Clinton 's denial , but later admission , about having an affair with intern Monica Lewinsky ,
led to his impeachment by the House on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice .
At first , Lewinsky also denied , under oath ,
of having a sexual affair with the President .
Later , the Office of the Special Prosecutor investigating Clinton granted her immunity
to testify before the grand jury .
A videotape of that testimony was played at the senate 's trial of Clinton
but she was not called to testify in person .
Lewinsky later went public with the story of her affair with the President in a two-hour interview with Barbara Walters on ABC TV .
