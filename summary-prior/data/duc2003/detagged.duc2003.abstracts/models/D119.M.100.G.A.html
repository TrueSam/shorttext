A major breakthrough in India-Bangladesh relations occurred in 1996
when a long-standing dispute over Ganges River water was apparently settled with a 30-year agreement .
Issues remaining included India 's desire for a transit route through Bangladesh , disputed border territories , smuggling into Bangladesh , Bangladeshi refugees in India , and Bangladesh 's request for tariff concessions .
The status quo on the border was accepted in 1997 .
In 1998 the Ganges water dispute arose again
and the refugees were still in India .
By 2000 talks by border security forces were underway over clashes on the disputed border and smuggling .
Transit route and tariff concessions were not on the agenda .
