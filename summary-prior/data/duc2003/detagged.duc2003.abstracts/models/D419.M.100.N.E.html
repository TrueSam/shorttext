About 240 million tires are discarded in the United States each year .
A small percentage of these tires can be retreaded for future use
and various initiatives are underway to recycle those remaining .
Uses for discarded tires include grinding them up into a `` crumb . ''
The crumb is used to manufacture carpet underlay as well as being mixed with asphalt for paving .
Paving a mile with a rubber-asphalt mix can use the equivalent of 16,000 tires .
Discarded tires also are being made into jogging tracks , crash barriers , jungle gyms , mud flaps , sandals , doormats and hockey pucks .
Discarded tires also are tied together to make artificial reefs .
