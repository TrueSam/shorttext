In vitro fertilization is the process
whereby a woman 's egg is fertilized by a man 's sperm in a lab dish .
The fertilized egg can then be implanted into the womb of an infertile woman .
This procedure has allowed couples
who were unable to conceive ,
to have a child .
A donor female 's egg is used in the process .
Sometimes fertilized eggs are frozen for later use .
In England , there is a shortage of donor eggs .
A suggestion has been made
that ovaries from aborted female fetuses be used
since they may contain up to a million eggs ;
an adult fertile woman 's ovaries might contain 100,000 eggs .
Such a plan , however , is highly controversial .
