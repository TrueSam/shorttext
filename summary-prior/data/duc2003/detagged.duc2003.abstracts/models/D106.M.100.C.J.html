Though a statistical rating system is used
to determine who plays in the national championship game , crowning of the champion is still subject to controversy .
The national title will still be determined by postseason polls .
If neither team in the championship game plays well ,
it may go to a third-rated team
that was impressive in its bowl game .
The rating system could also determine
that a team ranked third in the polls would play in the championship game .
Further , the championship game could fail to draw a big television audience
if both teams are from the same region of the country .
