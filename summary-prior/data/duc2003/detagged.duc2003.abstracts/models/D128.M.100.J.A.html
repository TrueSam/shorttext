In February-March 2000 the normally desert nation of Mozambique experienced devastating rains which caused the worst floods in 30 years .
At least 492 people were killed
and close to a million were left homeless .
The floods wiped out crop fields creating an extended food shortage .
The grave situation was exacerbated by land mines moved by the floods to new unknown locations .
International relief organizations , the U.N. , and national governments rushed financial and material aid to the stricken nation ,
but some deemed it too little too late .
In May 2000 the international community pledged $ 452.9 million for reconstruction of the Mozambique infrastructure .
