Canada divided its Northwest Territory into two ,
giving the Intuit people a territory of their own ,
renamed Nunavut .
For over twenty years they negotiated their aboriginal land claim with the Canadian government .
Agreeing to give up all future claims , 
their settlement culminated with the new territory , 
outright title to 135,000 square miles of the territory , 
significant mineral rights 
and $ 1 billion over 14 years .
Isolated , the Inuit people have been able to maintain their language and culture .
Although excited about self-governance , old problems persist .
Nunavut remains the poorest of Canada 's territories and the Intuit have severe problems with alcoholism , suicide and crime .
