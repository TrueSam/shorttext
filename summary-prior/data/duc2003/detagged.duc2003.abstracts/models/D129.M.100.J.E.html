The Year 2000 ( Y2K ) problem ,
where computers are expected to to recognize the date change from 99 to 00 ,
have been known about since the mid-1980s .
Even so , active measures to deal with the problem
and make computers compliant did not begin until 1996 .
By 1998 , measures to deal with the Y2K problem were underway at the international level , such as the Declaration of Cooperation and Support of Asian Y2K ,
to cooperation on the local level .
Despite this cooperation , extremist groups were urging members
to take measures
to protect themselves .
There is some belief
that fear of Y2K will present the greatest problems .
