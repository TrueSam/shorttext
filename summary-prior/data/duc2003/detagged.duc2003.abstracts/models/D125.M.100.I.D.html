Neutrinos are tiny particles having no electrical charge .
Only recently we learned they have mass .
There are three known types of neutrinos .
Nobelist Frederick Reines isolated the electron neutrino in 1956 .
The muon neutrino was identified in 1962 .
Detection of the tau neutrino was even more difficult .
Detection efforts were carried out under Antarctica , under the Aegean Sea , under the Alps , and in other locations .
The super-Kamiokande effort in Japan was most successful .
An international team found evidence that neutrinos have mass ,
and suggested the presence of tau neutrinos .
The tau was positively identified at the Fermi laboratory in July 2000 .
