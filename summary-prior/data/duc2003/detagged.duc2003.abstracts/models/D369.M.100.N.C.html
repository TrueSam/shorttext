Bulimia and anorexia nervosa are eating disorders
which most often afflict adolescent women , seldom men .
Victims are characterized by an irrational compulsion to remain thin .
Those suffering anorexia nervosa practice excessive dieting , sometimes to the point of starvation .
Bulimics will binge eat ,
but then use laxatives or self-induced vomiting to keep their weight down .
Causes are uncertain ;
however , some experts believe they begin in childhood
with parentally induced eating requirements .
Some think anorexia nervosa is caused by diet-triggered opiates in the brain
so that hunger is overridden by euphoria .
Treatment for both is generally successful .
Prozac may be prescribed for bulimics .
