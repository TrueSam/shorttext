Mozambican flooding , the worst in 30 years , began in mid-February , 2000
and continued , almost unabated , until mid-March .
First the southern and central parts of the country were hit , then the north .
Almost 500 people died
and one million were either homeless or in desperate need of help .
250,000 people were sheltered in 64 camp care-centers .
Foreign countries provided early rescue with planes , ships and helicopters
to pluck people from trees and rooftops
and to ferry in foodstuff and medical aid .
Eventually , the United Nations made a U.S. $ 450 million appeal from its community of nations for flood relief and rebuilding .
