The 2000 Republican presidential candidate was known after Super Tuesday .
The field narrowed from 11 in mid-1999 , to four by February , to Bush alone .
The various methods states use to select delegates were examined and manipulated ,
and changes for 2004 were discussed .
States vied to select first .
Super Tuesday , with 16 states , left the Western Primary irrelevant .
California tried to end winner-take-all for 2000 , then its blanket primary was declared unconstitutional .
After the governor of New York failed to restrict the 2000 election ,
he sought to widen the 2004 .
Some politicians want to lengthen the process
and counteract the power of specific small states and regions .
