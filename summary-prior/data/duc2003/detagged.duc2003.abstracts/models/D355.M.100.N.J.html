Because of the huge dimensions and constant motion of the world 's oceans , space-borne monitoring is the principle technique for ocean surveillance .
Many oceanographic satellites , including the early SEASAT-A
( U.S. ) , the ERS-1 ( ESA ) , and the JERS-1 ( Japan ) , employed a synthetic aperture radar as an advanced microwave sensor to detect dynamic phenomena , such as the roughness of the ocean 's surface .
SEASAT-A also had a single , visible light radiometer .
The SEAWIFS ( U.S. ) , however , will employ eight sensors in the visible light band
which will obtain data on the ocean 's chlorophyll concentration , suspended mud and sand content , and water quality .
