Among automobile manufacturer 's efforts to develop low-polluting , hydrogen-powered vehicles ,
three differing technologies compete .
The first is to use hydrogen gas directly as a fuel , i.e. ,
burn it directly in the engine 's combustion chamber similarly to the present-day use of gasoline .
A second method is to use hydrogen as an energy source within a fuel cell .
The fuel cell converts the hydrogen directly to electricity by electromechanical means ,
which then powers the vehicle .
The third method uses a nickel-based and hydrogen-occluded alloy ( nickel-hydrogen ) battery .
Under this method , the vehicle gets its power from electricity
stored in the battery ,
which must be frequently recharged .
