The Supreme Court , in a controversial 5 to 4 vote , upheld a Federal court decision
to ban the use of statistical sampling in the 200 census .
Favored by the Clinton Administration ,
proponents maintain that statistical sampling , along with traditional methods ,
will allow for a more accurate count , especially of minority populations .
Over 8 million people , mostly minorities , were not counted in the 1990 census .
House Republicans , whose suit led to the Supreme Court decision ,
maintain that statistical sampling will be used to the benefit of Democrats
since count results could be used
to redraw voting district lines .
