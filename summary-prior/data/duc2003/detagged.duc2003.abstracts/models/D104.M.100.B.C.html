The Waco disaster occurred on April 19 , 1993 after a 51 day siege by government agents of the religious sect Branch Dividian 's compound
resulting in the deaths of 80 Davidians .
An initial Justice Department report claimed all deaths were the fault of the Dividians .
Six years later , responding to accusations of government cover-up , lawsuits and new FBI revelations , Attorney General Janet Reno appointed an independent investigator
to learn the truth . 
The results of former Senator Danforth 's investigation was that federal agents did not start the fire
or shoot at cult members causing death ,
and did not engage in a major cover-up .
