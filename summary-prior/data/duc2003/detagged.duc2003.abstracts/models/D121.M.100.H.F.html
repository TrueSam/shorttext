Interpol , the International Police Organization
headquartered in Lyon , France , generally takes the lead in organizing multinational efforts to combat crime .
Because of the increased sophistication of criminals , Interpol is constantly faced with the need
to upgrade its strategies
and increase the level of international cooperation .
Car theft and smuggling is a growing problem for police units world-wide .
Countering the drug traffic , long a problem , is worsened by the growing strength of the drug lords .
In addition to fighting crime across national borders , police units must now form stronger links
to combat international terrorism .
