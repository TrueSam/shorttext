Anorexia Nervosa is an eating disorder
in which patients starve themselves .
Bulimia is a related eating disorder in which those so afflicted ingest large quantities of food
and then induce vomiting to stay thin .
Both are seen primarily in young women
who perceive themselves as already overweight or on their way there .
An addiction to the opiates produced by the brain while dieting may cause eating disorders .
One study shows that most anorexic girls outgrow the disorder
as they grow older Cathy Rigby , gymnast turned actress , battled bulimia for 12 years .
She binged on food and then took laxatives and induced vomiting .
