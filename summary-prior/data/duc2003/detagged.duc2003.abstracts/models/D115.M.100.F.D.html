It is estimated the 1990 census count missed 8.4 million Americans .
Most of those were minorities , the poor , those living in urban areas .
The democratic administration responsible for the 2000 census wanted to use statistical sampling , especially since those likely to be missed without sampling would likely vote democratic .
The republicans opposed sampling ,
saying the constitution mandates a head count .
A divided Supreme Court ruled against sampling , at least regarding numbers used in apportioning representatives among states .
Democrats pushed for two counts .
The sampled count would be used for allocating funds for federal programs ,
and aligning election districts .
The republicans threatened to withhold census funds .
