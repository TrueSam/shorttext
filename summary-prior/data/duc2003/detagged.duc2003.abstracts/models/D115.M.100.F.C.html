Census data is used to apportion the 435 Congressional House seats ,
distribute federal aid
and reshape election districts .
The 1990 census failed to count 8.4 million people
and double counted 4.4 million people .
The Clinton administration believed that accuracy would be improved by using statistical sampling methods , rather than a pure headcount .
Republicans , fearful that Democrats would misuse sampling to increase their constituency ,
filed suit to prohibit its use .
A lower court panel ruling that statistical sampling , though allowed , cannot be used for apportionment was upheld by the Supreme Court .
Census then collected data under both methods ,
each to be used for different purposes .
