In 1978 , the United States launched SEASAT-A , the world 's first integrated marine observation satellite .
Since then , numerous satellites launched by the world 's space agencies have been wholly or principally dedicated to studying oceanography .
These satellites widely use synthetic aperture radar ( SAR )
because it has distinctive advantages over other technologies to acquire imagery .
Among them is weather independence .
Scientists monitor the dynamic ocean environment and observe ocean color , etc. This information is used
to meet needs in areas such as understanding global climate changes , weather forecasting , marine products , marine engineering , ocean transportation , disaster prevention , ocean exploration , ocean management , and military operations .
