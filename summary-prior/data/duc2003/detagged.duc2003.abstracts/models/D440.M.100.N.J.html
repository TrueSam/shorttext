Efforts to halt the rise in violations of child labor laws were apparent in the U.S. , at both the national and state levels , and abroad in the early 1990s .
In March 1990 , a U.S. congressman called for mandatory jail terms and fines to a maximum of $ 100,000 for repeat violators .
That same month , in California , authorities raided over 70 sewing shops
and issued fines to repeat offenders of wage laws , including child-labor regulations .
In China , in 1991 , after authorities cracked a crime ring
supplying children to factories in Guangdong , tough new laws against child labor , involving stiff penalties , were passed .
