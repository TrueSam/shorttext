Nine European Community ( EC ) countries - Germany , France , the Netherlands , Belgium , Luxembourg , Italy , Spain , Portugal and Greece -
have signed the Schengen Accord , designed to abolish formal controls on passports and goods
so that travelers can pass freely across internal West European borders .
Internal checks will be abolished when external frontiers have been sufficiently strengthened .
Britain , Ireland and Denmark are withholding full commitment
until that strengthening and certain non-EC matters are confirmed .
Participating countries will be obligated to adopt their national information systems to a central information system in Strasbourg , especially in relation to fighting drug trafficking
and linking police and immigration authorities .
