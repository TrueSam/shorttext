The U.S. FDA has given Warner-Lambert clearance to market Cognex , the first U.S. approved drug for treatment of Alzheimer 's disease .
Although Cognex does not alter the course of the underlying dementia process ,
it effectively alleviates symptoms in the mild-to-moderate stages of the disease .
Many companies are working a new class of Alzheimer 's drugs ,
called nootropics .
Specifically , SmithKline Beecham 's oxiracetam , UCB of Belgium 's piracetam , Warner-Lambert 's tacrine , the U.S. company Forest Laboratories ' physostigmine are in this category .
However , to date , none is licensed and none cures the underlying cause of Alzheimer 's
which is the build-up of amyloid protein plaques
that kill brain cells .
