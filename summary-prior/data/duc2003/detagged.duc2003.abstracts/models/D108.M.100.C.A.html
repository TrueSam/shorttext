Eleven people contended for the Republican nomination for president in 2000 .
By the time of the New Hampshire primary six candidates had dropped out
and a seventh soon followed .
McCain won New Hampshire ,
leaving the race to him , Bush , Forbes and Keyes . .
Then Forbes dropped out .
Bush won South Carolina , Iowa and Delaware
while McCain claimed Michigan and Arizona .
McCain faded in early March
and Bush had such a commanding lead
that McCain withdrew on March 10 , almost eight months before the election .
The primaries proved anti-climactic
but they pointed out problems with the system recognized at state and national level .
