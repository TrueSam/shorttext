Studies that show increases in auto accidents are prompting many state and local legislators
to consider or propose bans on the use of hand-held cellular phones while driving .
Bans were passed in Brooklyn , Ohio and Marleboro Township , N.J. ,
and Hilltown Township , Conshohocken and Lebanon , PA , and on use by taxi drivers in New York City .
However , there is slow response generally because of considerations of difficulty in enforcement and evidence
of benefits for personal productivity and public safety ( e.g. , reporting accidents and drunken driving ) outweighing high risks .
Telecommunication giant AT&T backs much of the opposition to the proposed restrictions .
