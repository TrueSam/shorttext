There are a number of fatal accidents on California highways
for which there appear to be no apparent cause .
Most of these accidents involve two or more vehicles
and are caused by an automobile
swerving into oncoming traffic or by improper lance changes .
In the case of single car fatalities , the drivers have lost control of their car
and run off the road .
Speed does not appear to be the primary cause in the multiple car accidents
since many of the drivers were driving at or below the speed limit .
Speed , however , did appear to be a factor in the single car accidents .
