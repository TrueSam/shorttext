Research indicates that an addiction to opiates
produced by the brain during dieting may be the cause of anorexia nervosa .
Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder
which causes people to starve themselves , sometimes to death .
The opiates in question are called endorphins .
Endorphins normally cause a high which increases hunger .
In anorexics , however , the hunger is overridden by euphoria .
Starving also leads to binge eating , a trait common also to individuals with bulimia .
Bulimia involves individuals who see themselves as overweight
or who think they will become overweight .
Bulimics typically binge when eating
and then make themselves vomit to remain thin .
