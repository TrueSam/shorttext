Two years after astronauts replaced and repaired older scientific instruments in the Hubble Space Telescope in 1997 , failing gyroscopes forced NASA to schedule its regular repair mission about eight months early .
The plan is to replace all six gyroscopes and essential computer , radio , camera , guiding systems and solar panels .
Just before the scheduled launch in November , a fourth gyroscope faltered forcing celestial observations to halt .
A shuttle , launched in early December ,
captured the Hubble and the crew replaced the six gyroscopes on the first spacewalk .
On the second spacewalk , astronauts replaced the central computer and a precision pointing sensor device .
