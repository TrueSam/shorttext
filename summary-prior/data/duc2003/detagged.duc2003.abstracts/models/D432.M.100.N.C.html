Some minorities believe
that police unjustifiably single out minority drivers for detention , arrest , mistreatment and at times , brutality .
For example , the Long Beach Police Department is currently under fire as the result of a videotaped sting operation
in which an officer appeared to shove the victim 's face through a plate glass window for being black , wearing dirty clothes and occupying a 12 year-old car .
The videotape is considered evidence of a pattern of violence in Southern California law enforcement primarily against blacks or Latinos .
The arresting officer 's attorney says that Jackson , the victim , was not stopped for discriminatory reasons .
