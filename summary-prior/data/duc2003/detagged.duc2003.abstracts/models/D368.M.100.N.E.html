In vitro fertilization involved fertilizing a woman 's egg with a man 's sperm in the laboratory .
The egg is then incubated for up to 36 hours
before it is implanted in the woman .
The success rate for such a procedure is around 12 % .
The odds for a successful pregnancy appear to increase
if the embryo is frozen before implantation
and a woman can have several eggs fertilized at the same time .
Doctors warn that if a woman has not had a successful pregnancy by the sixth attempt ,
it is unlikely the procedure will be successful
and they counsel against further attempts .
