The euro stems from a proposal in 1995 by the European Commission for a single currency for the 15 nations of the European Union .
Worries about devaluation of national currencies and the loss of financial sovereignty were overcome for the most part ,
although Britain , Denmark , Sweden , and Greece elected not to participate .
After exchange rates with national currencies were fixed , the euro was in business on Jan. 1,1999 .
Analysts differed on the possible effect on trade with the U.S. and the Asian market .
Euro bank notes and coins were to be introduced in Jan. 2002 and national currencies to be replaced in July 2002 .
