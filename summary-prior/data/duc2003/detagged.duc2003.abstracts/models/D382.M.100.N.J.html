Mazda and Daimler-Benz are pursuing different strategies for developing a commercially viable hydrogen fueled automobile .
Mazda , in 1991 , demonstrated a concept car
that used hydrogen gas
stored in fuel tanks containing a hydrogen-occluded alloy .
The gas is directly injected into the proprietary rotary engine cylinders
immediately after completion of the intake stoke ,
resulting in a higher output than that produced during earlier experiments
when both air and hydrogen were injected simultaneously .
Daimler-Benz is experimenting with fuel cells
that convert hydrogen ( obtained from methanol ) to electricity by electrochemical means .
Daihatsu Motor Co. and Honda have also demonstrated hydrogen fueled vehicles .
