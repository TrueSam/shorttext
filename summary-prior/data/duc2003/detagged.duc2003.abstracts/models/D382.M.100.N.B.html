Automakers are developing prototype vehicles
that make use of hydrogen energy .
Mazda 's HR-X2 uses a hydrogen-gas fueled rotary engine
that effectively prevents abnormal combustion normally associated with using hydrogen as a fuel in conventional engines .
These engines provide approximately 90 percent of gasoline RE output
yet emit very low levels of HC , CO and NOx .
Daimler-Benz is using fuel cells with methanol
from which the hydrogen is obtained in the vehicle .
Fuel cells convert combustible liquids or gases directly to electricity by electrochemical means with a relatively high efficiency of up to 60 percent .
This vehicle is called a `` true zero emission vehicle '' .
