Historically , India and Bangladesh have had major disagreements over the division of the water in the Ganges River ; India 's ability to transit goods to its northeastern states through Bangladesh ; tariff relief for Bangladesh ; refugees
who have been in India since Bangladesh 's 1971 war of independence ; and the demarcation and security of their 4,310-kilometer-long border .
A 30-year treaty on the water was signed in 1996 .
Meetings at all levels continue to be held on the other topics .
By 2000 the border seemed to be the most volatile issue , with sporadic fighting , smuggling ( even of women and children ) ,
and crossings by militant rebels .
