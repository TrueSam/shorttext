Many ships are lost at sea in bad weather such as the `` Derbyshire '' which in 1980 sank without a trace in a typhoon off Japan killing all 44 of its crew .
Worse , in 1994 a storm on the Baltic Sea ripped off the outer bow door of the ferry `` Estonia ''
allowing water to pour in
and quickly sink the vessel .
More than 900 passengers perished .
Sailors should avoid the Cornish coast where an 80 mile stretch of rocky exposed shoreline offers no safe harbor and the coastline near La Coruna , Spain
where there are calm seas barely 86 days a year .
Bon voyage !
Have a nice day !
