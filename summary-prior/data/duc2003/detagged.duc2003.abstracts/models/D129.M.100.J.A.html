As the year 2000 ( Y2K )
approached there was worldwide concern over ramifications of computer problems associated with a four-digit change of year .
Some seemed overconfident that all was well
while others forecast disaster .
Some organizations were `` Y2K compliant '' as early as 1998 ,
but smaller ones tended to lag behind .
Groups were formed and businesses were established to deal with Y2K technical problems
or prepare for major economic and social disruption .
Airlines in Poland and Viet Nam canceled all flights for Jan.1 , 2000 ,
but in the U.S. prominent officials announced plans to be in the air as 2000 arrived .
Actually nobody knew what would happen .
