Latin Americans and Chinese seeking to immigrate into the United States were frequent subjects of human smuggling .
Latin Americans , especially Mexicans , Guatemalans , and Salvadorians , often reached safe houses or staging areas in southern California .
Many were then moved through the country via commercial airlines , Amtrak , or motor vehicles .
Chinese were smuggled into the U.S. by freighters and fishing trawlers .
Several such boats wrecked or were apprehended by the Coast Guard .
The Chinese also arrived in the U.S. from Mexico , Canada , Europe , Puerto Rico , or the Dominican Republic .
Boats also smuggled Chinese to Japan ,
despite Chinese government interdiction efforts .
