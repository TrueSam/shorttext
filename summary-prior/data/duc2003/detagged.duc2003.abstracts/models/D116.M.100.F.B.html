Creationists say a divine being created humans and other species .
They say that since evolution cannot be observed or replicated in a laboratory ,
there is no evidence that it actually occurred .
The Supreme Court ruled that states cannot compel the teaching of creationism .
So , instead of trying to push creationism onto the curriculum , many creationists try to keep the theory of evolution out of the classroom
or ensure that if evolution is taught , it is presented as merely one , unproven theory .
A Gallup poll found
that about 45 percent believe in creationism and another 40 percent believe evolution was set in motion by a divine being .
