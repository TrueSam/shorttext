E. coli is a usually harmless bacterium
found in human and animal intestines .
A mutated strain , 0157 : H7 , however , produces Shiga toxin
which can cause severe abdominal pain , diarrhea , and , in severe cases , kidney failure .
Outbreaks of 0157 : H7 have been linked to cow manure
that is passed to humans through contact with poorly butchered meat and by contact with food handlers
who do not wash their hands after using the restroom .
Other sources of 0157 : H7 infection are undercooked meat , unpasteurized juices , unwashed ground crops , and contaminated water .
Only once , possible twice , has the bacteria been transmitted in chlorinated swimming water .
