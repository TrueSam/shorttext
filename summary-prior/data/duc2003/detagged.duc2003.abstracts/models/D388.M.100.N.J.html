Sludge is rich in nitrogen and phosphorous , important plant nutrients ,
and
can reduce the need for water .
Some say it will also reduce the need for harmful pesticides .
It has , however , a major drawback - the odor .
Nevertheless , 42 % of the 1.1m dry tons of sludge
produced yearly in the UK are used for cereal crops and grassland .
In 1990 , Los Angeles , for the first time , allowed sludge to be used on farmland .
It could not be used on crops grown for human consumption ,
and the city and the farm concern were required to conduct extensive water and soil sampling .
