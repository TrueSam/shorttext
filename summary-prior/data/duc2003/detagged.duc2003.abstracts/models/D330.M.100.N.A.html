After their war of 1980-88 Iraq offered to restore diplomatic relations with Iran ,
withdraw its troops from occupied Iranian territory , exchange thousands of prisoners
and share control of the Shatt al Arab waterway .
Iraq was reported to have shipped refined oil to Iran
and , in exchange for aid from Iran , was handing over Iranian resistance fighters .
Similarly , following the Gulf War of 1991 , Iranian and Iraqi diplomats met to coordinate efforts against establishment of a Kurdish state in North Iraq ,
discuss formation of a broader anti-U.S. alliance ,
and to take joint economic action to ameliorate effects of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq .
