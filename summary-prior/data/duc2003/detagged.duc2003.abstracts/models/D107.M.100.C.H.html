Recent increases in death penalty opposition have been prompted by discoveries of innocent people on death row , requests for clemency by public figures , and pleas for death penalty renunciation by the UN , the ABA and the Pope .
Concerns have arisen over shortened appeals times , numbers of condemned , judicial system errors , and death penalty expansions .
Opponents have become more effective .
Some opposition is moral , stressing the sanctity of life and need to show compassion and forgiveness .
Others claim the death penalty is unfairly applied to the poor and minorities .
Others say capital punishment continues the cycle of violence
without providing healing , closure , or crime deterrence .
Life sentences without parole are sufficient .
