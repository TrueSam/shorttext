Neutrinos are subatomic particles
that carry no electrical charge ,
and are so light that they were assumed for many years to have no mass at all .
Three types of neutrinos are known to exist .
Neutrinos rarely interact with other matter ,
but scientists successfully designed an experiment to catch a glimpse of sparks created when neutrinos collide with atoms .
To avoid distortion , the Super Kamiokande international research team worked in an abandoned mine shaft in central Japan .
They detected that some neutrinos oscillate , or change type , as they pass through space or matter .
According to widely accepted theory , if something oscillates , it must have mass .
