Rabies is wide spread
and involves dogs , cats , and farm animals as well as wild life ,
including foxes and bats .
Measures being taken to prevent the spread of rabies include vaccination of pets and live stock
and leaving vaccinated bait for wild animals .
In Shanghai , all pet dogs were ordered killed because of an outbreak of rabies
while in Central and South America , ways are being sought to reduce the bat population .
Other than vaccination , killing the infected animals is the most widespread remedy .
People also are being warned to avoid contact with wild animals
and are being urged to keep their pets indoors .
