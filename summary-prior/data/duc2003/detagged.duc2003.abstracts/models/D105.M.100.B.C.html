A local controversy exploded into an international , vote-buying bribery scandal .
The world was rocked by evidence of gifts , favors , `` humanitarian aid '' and scholarship payments to International Olympic Committee site selection members by officials of the winning site , Salt Lake City .
They amounted to more than one million dollars .
Further , an IOC official cited alleged irregularities in the selection of at least three other Olympic cities over the past ten years .
The Salt Lake scandal led to the ouster of six IOC executive board members and the criminal indictment of two Salt Lake bid officials by the U.S. Justice Department .
