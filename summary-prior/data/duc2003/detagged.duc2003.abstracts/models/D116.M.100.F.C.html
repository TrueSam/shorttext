The Supreme Court ruled over a decade ago
that teaching creationism violated the constitutional separation of church and state .
Opponents of this ruling now pursue their only remaining tactic
-- to limit the teaching of evolution .
This tactic was recently , effectively employed in Kansas .
There a conservative Board of Education muddied the science curriculum by ruling
that the teaching of evolution is optional in each or the state 's 304 school districts .
Furthermore , questions on the `` big bang '' theory of creation , age of the earth or universe , and macroevolution , i.e. , the process of change from one species to another , would not be on any state standardized tests .
