Customs inspectors , narcotics experts , and other law-enforcement agents are trained to watch for signs of `` fishy '' circumstances about a vehicle 's driver , occupants , goods hauled , documentation , etc .
The Long Beach Police Department is under fire because of a videotaped incident during a traffic stop
in which a white officer appeared to shove a man 's face through a plate glass window for being black .
The injured party , a policeman himself , insists that the videotape illustrates racial brutality .
Others disagree , saying that the videotape does n't determine whether there was `` lawful necessity '' for the force used ,
and that it does not establish a pattern of racism .
