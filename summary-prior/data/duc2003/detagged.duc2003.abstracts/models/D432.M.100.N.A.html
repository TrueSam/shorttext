`` Profiling '' by customs and immigration officials at border crossings is one thing ,
but `` profiling '' by police departments to discriminate against minorities is quite another .
The Los Angeles Times has reported cases in which police appeared to act on the basis of anti-black/Latino prejudice rather than due cause .
In the most flagrant case , the police violently assaulted a black driver after stopping him for a minor traffic offense .
In another , an officer followed a Latino driver for several blocks ,
stopped next to him at a stop light ,
got a good look at him ,
and charged him with a violation .
Traffic checkpoints facilitate profiling .
