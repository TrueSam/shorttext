Several commercial schools exist in the United States
and many cater to foreign pilots-to-be .
Some are narrowly focused , such as the Moody Missionary school
which trains pilots to support missionary work .
China has increased pilot training overall
and has increased the number of woman pilots in the military and in civil aviation .
Specialized training exists to teach pilots new techniques and to cope with unforeseen situations .
Military air forces train their pilots
but some , the US for example , are beginning to use commercial schools .

because of pilot training of foreign students ,
but these concerns were set aside .
