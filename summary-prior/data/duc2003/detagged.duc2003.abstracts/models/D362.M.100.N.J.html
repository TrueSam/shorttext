During an INS crackdown on alien smuggling operations
that netted 79 illegals at the Atlanta airport in February 1989 ,
officials learned that some people paid up to $ 4,000 for air fare , meals , housing , and a U.S. job .
There is also evidence of forced confinement of illegal aliens in `` drop houses ''
until they or their relatives pay a ransom .
In June 1989 , federal officials found 47 immigrants
involuntarily held in a `` drop house . ''
In August 1990 , 90 Latin American illegal immigrants were found similarly detained .
In one raid of a `` drop house , ''
a fee schedule for the services the immigrants required was seized .
