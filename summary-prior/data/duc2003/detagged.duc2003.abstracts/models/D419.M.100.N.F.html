Hydroponic farming is a method of growing plants
that is totally different for the traditional soil method .
It involves the use of a nutrient rich water base
and controlled grow lighting .
The promise of this method
is that more food can be produced on a smaller surface area .
This would have immediate application
to providing fresh food in areas
where space is at a premium
and it could also serve to support humans during space travel .
Drug dealers have been quick to seize upon this method by growing marijuana in basements or other secluded interior areas .
