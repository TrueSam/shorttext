An August 2000 poll of registered voters indicates
most Americans support the death penalty ,
but many with reservations .
The concern most often voiced
was that an innocent person would be executed .
A poll taken in California in early 2000 revealed
that nearly half of respondents thought
that life without parole , rather than the death penalty , was the proper punishment for murder .
There is also concern among lawmakers and the public
that the application of the death penalty is racially and economically discriminatory .
Finally , an interfaith conference of religious leaders called the death penalty `` morally untenable . ''
