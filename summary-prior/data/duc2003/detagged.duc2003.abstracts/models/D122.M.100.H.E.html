Cashews are a major crop for Tanzania , Mozambique , and Vietnam
and are under development in India and Sri Lanka .
Over the past decade , the cashew harvest in these countries has been adversely affected by drought , cold , weather , and social upheaval .
The decline in the cashew harvest affected not only the farmer but also the workers in the nut processing facilities as plants
operated below capacity .
There has been a concerted effort to turn production around
and harvest were up in most countries .
Labor problems in Mozambique threaten this progress
as production workers seek to bar the export of raw cashews ; a move
that means lower prices for farmers .
