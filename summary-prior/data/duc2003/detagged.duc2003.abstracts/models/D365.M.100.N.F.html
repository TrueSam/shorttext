El Nino , the phenomenon
caused by warming waters in the Western Pacific , has brought about changes in rainfall patterns across much of the globe .
These disrupted rainfall patterns have had serious effects on crops in North and South America , Africa , and Australia .
El Nino is blamed for excessive rainfall across the Gulf states of the US , sometimes an increase of ten times the normal amount .
The increased rainfall has been responsible for winter floods in Texas .
Fishing along the Pacific coast of South America has been hampered by the warmer waters due to El Nino causing many species of fish to move to deeper , cooler waters farther away from the coast .
