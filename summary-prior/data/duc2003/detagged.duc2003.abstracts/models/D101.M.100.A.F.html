Flooding on the Yangtze River in 1998 , the most severe since 1954 , left thousands dead ,
millions homeless ,
and threatened over two million hectares of farmland .
Over a million soldiers and civilians were pressed into service
fighting the floodwaters .
In many cases , dams and dikes were destroyed in an attempt to disperse water upstream
and lessen the impact downstream .
Abnormal movement of the rain front lingering along the mid and lower Yangtze
coupled with torrential rains in the upper Yangtze
brought about the devastating flooding .
Excessive logging on hillsides , now banned , contributed
since the eroded soil left behind could not absorb much water .
