The demand for cashews had led several third world countries to increase production .
Vietnam , now trails only the world 's leaders , India and Brazil .
Cashew trees like any agricultural product are subject to the fluctuation of climate and of soil condition .
Also they are subject to the policies of the government and the country 's special interests and to external influences such as the World Bank .
Mozambique cashews grow on small farms of poor farmers .
They are processed under a state monopoly
that arbitrarily sets low prices
and employs many workers at low wages .
The World Bank provides financial assistance and advice to Mozambique
to improve production
but also puts conditions on its loans .
