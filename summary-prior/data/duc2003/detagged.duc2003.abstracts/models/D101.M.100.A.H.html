The 1998 Yangtze River floods , worst since 1954 , killed 3,000
and cost $ 31 billion in losses .
Partial cause was a longer and heavier rainy season in most of the valley , like 1931 and 1954 .
But 1998 damage was exacerbated by recent rapid growth and environmental devastation .
Deforestation sends silt into rivers and lakes ,
and dikes built to prevent floods and reclaim wetlands limit flood-discharging capacity .
Some lakes have lost 50 % of their capacity .
Erosion areas have doubled since the 50s .
The government , at scientists ' urging , finally banned some riverside logging and grazing .
1999 floodwaters approached 1998 levels ,
but consolidated dikes , dredged rivers , and resettlement allowed floodwater discharge and damage was lessened .
