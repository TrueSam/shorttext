Stoicism is defined as the quiet acceptance of pain and defeat as one 's preordained lot in life ,
as exemplified by the Roman Philosopher Epictetus .
Further , if a completely new beginning is to be made , nothing of the old must remain .
The principles of Stoicism today seem to be presented only adjectivally
to describe situations rather than as a professed philosophy by which to live .
Politicians , political commentators , writers and artists may depict situations as being stoical in nature , such as real-life , present-day situations and relationships found in India and the Middle East 
or as fictional or allegorical theater presentations .
