Neutrinos are , ghostly sub-atomic particles
that travel at close to the speed of light ,
have no electrical charge ,
and have minimal interaction with other matter .
They were hypothesized in 1931
but not discovered experimentally until 1956 .
First thought to be without mass ,
the discovery of their mass in 1998 affects long-standing fundamental theories of how particles work .
This has profound consequences about the formation and evolution of matter , the galaxies and the ultimate fate of the universe .
They may explain the universe 's `` missing mass '' .
Existing in three types , called `` flavors '' , 
the third and smallest was not discovered until year 2000 .
