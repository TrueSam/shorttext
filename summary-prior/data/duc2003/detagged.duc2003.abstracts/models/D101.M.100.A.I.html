The summer of 1998 floods on the 3,900-mile long Yangtze River in China reached historic proportions .
Three thousand were killed
and the cost was estimated at $ 31.7 billion .
The flood control work focused on building and reinforcing dikes and dams ,
evacuating residents ,
and intentionally flooding selected areas to protect other areas .
The Chinese realized other control measures must be addressed .
Logging , grazing , and fuel gathering had denuded hills up-stream .
Humans had encroached on wetlands ,
robbing their ability to absorb water .
Lake storage declined because of silt build-up and factory construction .
In 1999 money was earmarked for dredging and resettlement from wetlands .
