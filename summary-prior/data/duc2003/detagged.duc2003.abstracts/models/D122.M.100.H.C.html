The two distinct activities of the cashew business ,
growing and harvesting cashew nuts
and then processing and exporting them ,
constitute import sources of jobs and revenue for emerging nations .
After steadily increasing production acreage , in 1997 Vietnam exported 33,000 tons of processed cashews
to become the world 's second largest exporter .
Cold , drought , destructive insects , technology , skill of growers and government policy could all affect production .
Mozambican cashew nut processors ,
saying they would have to close
because local growers were exporting the raw nut ,
appealed to the government for protection .
India and Sri Lank formed a joint venture
to help increase their nut exports .
