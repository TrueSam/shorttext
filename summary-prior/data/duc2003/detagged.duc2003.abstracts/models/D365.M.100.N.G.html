The temperature warming effect of El Niino on weather patterns causes excessive or erratic rainfall , floods , severe winter storms , and droughts .
These developments diminish food stocks , the growth of crops essential to world trade ; e.g. , cocao , fish , soybeans ,
This , in turn , leads to lowering of commidity prices , higher interest rates , and lower GDP growth .
El Nino also causes thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in damage globally
and even severely disrupts habitats of endangered species .
The coincidence of El Nino with other climatogical events ;
for example , volcanic eruptions , lunar and solar cycles , and greenhouses effects , can cause more extensive effects .
