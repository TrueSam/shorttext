Online auction houses are among the fastest
growing Internet businesses .
Leader of the group is eBay .
It continues to increase its profits ,
expand its coverage ,
and even merge with or acquire competitors .
Internet auctioning is susceptible to fraud primarily through false claims for merchandise
offered or non-delivery after purchase .
It is difficult to tag the auction houses with fraud
unless they can be shown to have knowledge of a product offered . 
ebay , however , is under investigation for fraud by New York and Pennsylvania consumer authorities .
Many sellers have come to rely on Internet auctions
so any downtime causes them to lose business .
