Promising new methods are being explored worldwide for tire recycling .
In the U.S. alone , about 240 million old tires are discarded each year .
One initiative is to grind up tires into rubber `` crumb ''
which is then incorporated into other products such as road asphalt , rug underlay , drain pipes and insulation panels .
A second is to fuel energy plants by burning treated tires in an environmentally acceptable manner .
And a third is to chemically break tires down into by-products ,
including fuel gas , oil , zinc and carbon black .
The carbon can be used as an absorbent of organic chemicals from industrial effluent .
