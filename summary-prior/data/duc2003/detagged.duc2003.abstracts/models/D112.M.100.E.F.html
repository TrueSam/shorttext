The Hubble space telescope ,
launched in 1990 ,
has been a remarkable scientific success ,
but several space repair missions were required to keep it functioning .
The first was in 1993 , another in 1997 , and now in 1999 , still another is needed .
The most recent problem was caused by gyroscope failure making its precision pointing system non-functioning .
While the craft was in no peril ,
its inability to perform properly denied the scientific world much valuable data .
NASA opted to send the shuttle Discovery on a repair mission in late 1999 ,
rather than in 2000 , as planned .
That repair mission was successful
and Hubble 's capabilities were upgraded .
