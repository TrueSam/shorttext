`` Medecines Sans Frontierres '' was founded as an humanitarian aid organization in 1971 by ten French physicians
who were disillusioned with the International Red Cross .
`` Doctors Without Borders '' now has over 2000 volunteer medical personnel
serving in over 70 countries .
Its operating principle is that all victims of disaster ,
whether of natural or human origin , 
have a right to receive professional assistance as quickly as possible 
without regard to national boundaries and political circumstances or sympathies .
In addition to providing these services , a second mission , is to speak out against the atrocities it witnesses in the hope of preventing their future occurrence .
