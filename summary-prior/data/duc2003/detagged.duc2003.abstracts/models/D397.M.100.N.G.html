A wide range of US and foreign-built cars have been periodically recalled due to defective parts or mechanical systems failing to meet safety or performance standards .
Variably , the recalls were prompted by faulty ignition switches , throttle position sensors , shoulder and seat belts , seat mechanisms , brakes , coolants and coolant systems , and fuel tank seals .
Some were recalled for wiring problems causing fires or for rear suspension erosion .
A large number of cars recalled had exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency 's hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide exhaust emission standards due to faulty spark timing , air injection
and exhaust gas circulation , and electronic emission control systems .
