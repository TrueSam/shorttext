US satellites in space have discovered previously unknown phenomena in the vast reaches of outer space .
A so-called `` lumpiness '' in the universe has been noted
and is believed that gravity can form planets from this lumpiness .
`` Blobs '' , which are clouds of hot charged gas particles exist around Sagittarius A ,
each measuring a trillion miles in diameter .
A narrow sheet of galaxies half a billion light years in diameter , constitute one of the largest `` structures '' in the universe .
The satellites have also found supernovas ( exploding stars ) ,
neutron stars ( pulsars =AD remnants of exploding suns )
and evidence of the possibility of a black hole in the center of the Milky Way .
