Experts predict that space development will shift from satellites with position dependent missions , such as communications satellites , to satellite base stations .
These space stations will be facilities for research on the long-term effects of low gravity on animals and plants
and , eventually , will be staging areas for supplies
ferried from Earth to lunar colonies .
NASA intends for its space station Freedom to be operational by 1999
and an outpost on the Moon active by 2005 .
Additionally , the U.S. and Russia agreed to jointly develop space station Alpha
which will become an international project with Canada , Japan , and the European Space Agency participating .
