Most Americans support capital punishment
but the margin has narrowed .
A 1999 poll showed 71 % in favor , down from 80 % in 1994 .
By 2000 it was 60 % of whom 31 % strongly supported
and 29 % had doubts or reservations .
In 1999 there were political reflections of growing opposition
as measures reinstating the death penalty were defeated in Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , and Michigan .
A statement by the Roman Catholic bishops explained :
`` The pace of executions is numbing .
The discovery of people on death row who are innocent is frightening ''
and capital punishment `` is often applied unfairly and in racially biased ways . ''
