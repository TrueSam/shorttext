We are reentering a social climate
in which the cigar is tolerated .
This is evidenced by the emergence of more , young cigar smokers , 
the growth in production and sales of cigars , 
particularly the high end ( i.e. , expensive ) cigars , 
the proliferation of designated cigar smoking areas in quality hotels and restaurants 
and the promotion of cigar smoking events , such as dinners in those very same hotels and restaurants .
Cigar smoking is no longer only for `` old men '' .
In Boston , a group of women have their own little cigar club at the Ritz-Carlton there ,
and one of the members is Anwar Sadat 's daughter .
