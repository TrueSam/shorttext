According to a study released in December 1998 by San Francisco 's Public Health Department , low vacancy rates , exorbitant rents and loss of public housing units have exacerbated the homeless problem .
This conclusion echoes that reached in a study of homeless families conducted in New York .
The researchers in this study found that homeless families ,
when provided with subsidized housing could remain `` stable . ''
Yet another study on homelessness , this one by the Urban Institute , indicate
that the majority of homeless successfully left shelters for permanent housing
when they received social services including housing subsidies , substance-abuse treatment , health care , education , and job training .
