The Hubble Space Telescope , launched in 1990 ,
was designed for at least four service calls by visiting shuttle astronauts to repair and upgrade equipment .
The first , in 1993 , installed new optics
to correct an immediately apparent mirror problem .
The second occurred in 1997 .
The third was scheduled for June 2000 ,
but deteriorating gyroscopes threatening observation capability prompted emergency repairs .
A planned October 1999 mission to replace the gyroscopes was delayed by shuttle problems until December , then shortened to avoid Y2K complications .
A second service mission was scheduled for May 2001 .
A final servicing mission was planned for 2003 ,
although NASA since decided to operate Hubble through 2010 instead of 2005 .
