Persistent questions regarding FBI actions during the siege of the Branch Davidian compound near Waco and of a possible cover up have led both Attorney General Reno and FBI Director Freeh to pledge new investigations .
Suspicions were heightened by the late public disclosure
that agents had used tear gas grenades
even though that information had been given to ,
but overlooked by , Congress .
Former Senator John Danforth led a ten month investigation into these questions
and concluded
that blame for the Waco bloodshed
lies with the Davidians and not the FBI .
Several groups , however , remain skeptical of the Danforth conclusions .
