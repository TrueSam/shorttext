Organic fertilizers help soil retain moisture .
Cuba uses a mix of ash , vegetable waste and microorganisms .
England 's Kew gardeners work manure and compost into their beds .
And in Russia , farmyard manure and compost are favored .
But the coming thing in soil enhancers is sewage sludge .
California uses wet sludge , with or without yard clippings , for crops not intended for human consumption .
The U.K. also uses sludge for cereal crops and grasslands .
A French company dries sludge
and mixes in bark , sawdust and household waste .
While some activists argue that sewage sludge may pose a health hazard ,
it is clearly spurting forth as an organic fertilizer .
