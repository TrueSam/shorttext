The Russian MIR-2 was the starting point , then ,
U.S. technology with its laboratory module was added .
Plans were for an eventual international space station , involving the U.S. , Russia , Canada , Japan , and the European Space Association .
Impediments to plans included building a launch vehicle with a 200-to 300-ton lift capability .
