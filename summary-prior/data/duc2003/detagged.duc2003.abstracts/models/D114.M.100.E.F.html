The Czech Republic , Poland and Hungary are the first former Warsaw Pact members
that will become members of their one time opponent NATO .
The Czech Republic is at the top of the list
according to the Canadian Prime Minister .
Russia is apparently uneasy about Czech membership
and its ambassador to Prague has suggested
it might reconsider its economic relations with the Czechs .
But during a later visit the Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin said
Moscow was enhancing economic ties with Prague ,
but opposes eastward expansion of NATO .
A ceremony at the Harry Truman Library in Independence , Missouri marked the formal induction of these three countries .
