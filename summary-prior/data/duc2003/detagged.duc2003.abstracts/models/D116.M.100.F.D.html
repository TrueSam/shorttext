The dispute over teaching evolution in Kansas schools started in 1998
when a committee was appointed to recommend new science standards .
The School Board , spurred by conservatives ,
cast aside the committee 's recommendations and approved a standard that barely mentioned evolution .
The new standard made no mention of macroevolution ,
defined as changes from one species to another .
The 304 local school districts were left to implement the standard .
The Kansas decision drew nationwide attention .
National science organizations criticized it .
Educators said that Kansas college-bound students would be poorly prepared in the sciences .
Kansas received an F-minus in a nationwide rating of how states taught evolution .
