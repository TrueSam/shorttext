Medecins Sans Frontieres ( MSF ) ,
known in the US as Doctors Without Borders ,
was formed in 1971 ,
by a group of French doctors frustrated
while serving with various international humanitarian organizations .
The doctors found that these organizations were inefficient and reluctant to denounce those responsible for the problems
requiring medical assistance .
MSF adheres to the fundamental principle
`` that all disaster victims have a right to professional assistance
given as quickly and as efficiently as possible '' .
MSF volunteers generally work in harsh conditions .
The organization is quick to denounce hostile elements or governments
whose actions aggravate these conditions .
In 1999 , the MSF was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .
