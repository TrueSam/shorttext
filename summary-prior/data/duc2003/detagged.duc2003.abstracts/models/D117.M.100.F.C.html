Homelessness is a major , long-standing and intractable problem in most cities , particularly San Francisco .
Many homeless come from and continue a life of poverty , drug abuse , and physical or mental illness .
Cities lack the resources , particularly jobs , shelters and public housing ,
to adequately address the problem ;
and undercounting the homeless by census workers erroneously limits federal funding .
Advocacy groups say criminalizing the homeless may derail constructive methods to deal with them .
A study showed that the success rate is high for homeless families who are given subsidized housing .
Meanwhile , many homeless are viciously attacked
and murdered while living on the streets .
