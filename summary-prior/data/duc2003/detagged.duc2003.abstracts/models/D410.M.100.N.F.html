Nine members of the European Community :
Germany , France , Italy , Spain , Portugal , Greece , and the Benelux Countries , have agreed to implement the Schengen Accord .
Britain , Ireland , and Denmark are reluctant to go along with that agreement .
The Schengen Accord ,
named for the city in Luxembourg where it was signed ,
will allow for free access by EU members across internal borders .
Border security arrangements are yet
to be worked out for non EU travelers
and some Benelux Airports are being given extra time
to implement procedures .
The agreement also provides a framework for commonality of immigration and criminal records access .
