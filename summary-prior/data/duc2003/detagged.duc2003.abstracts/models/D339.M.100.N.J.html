Nootropics is a new class of drugs to enhance cognition .
Early nootropics increased the amount of acetylcholine , a neurotransmitter found at markedly low levels in Alzheimer patients .
Oxiracetam ( Smith Kline Beecham ) , physotigmine ( Forest Laboratories ) ,
and tacrine ( Cognex ) from Warner-Lambert , inhibit an enzyme which attacks acetylcholine ,
but all of these drugs offer only temporary relief from the disease 's symptoms .
According to Dr. Sykes , ondansetron is safer and as effective
as Cognex , the first FDA approved drug specifically for the treatment of Alzheimer 's .
It appears that the narrow therapeutic index of some early acetylcholinesterase inhibitors limits their administration at adequate doses to affect cognition .
