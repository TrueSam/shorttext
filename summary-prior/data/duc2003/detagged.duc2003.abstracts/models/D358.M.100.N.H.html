The higher a driver 's blood-alcohol level , the higher the probability that death will result .
The former state minimum of .10 that constituted proof of drunkenness , and at which it was illegal to drive , was reduced to .08 .
Of 16 fatal drunk-driving accidents , two involved drivers whose level was between .1 and .14 , six between .15 and .19 , six between .20 and .25 , and two between .26 and .29 .
The driver in one fatality had been arrested for drunk driving 43 hours earlier .
One driver whose level was .18 an hour after the accident may have had only a .04 level at the time of the collision .
