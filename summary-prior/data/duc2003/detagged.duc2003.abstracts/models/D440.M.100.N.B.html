Although the U . S. Labor Department has strict child-labor laws , ironclad enforcement has not been achieved .
Enforcement policies include surprise inspections , court injunctions , fines , and publication of names of violators .
Trade preferences can be withdrawn from countries
that abuse worker rights and there are moves in Congress to ban all imports of goods made by children .
Enforcement of child-labor laws in third-world countries is highly problematic .
International organizations have applied pressure .
The ILO and ICFTU have launched global campaigns to eradicate child labor .
Levi Strauss , of denim fame , and the Swiss retailer Migros insist
that suppliers and sub-contractors ban child labor .
