The early1990s artistic scene has demonstrated an interest in `` stoicism , '' the calm , expressionless acceptance of life 's vicissitudes as pre-ordained .
The number of performances of Burrows ' 50-minute dance , Stoics , increased at the Place and elsewhere in the 1990/1991 timeframe .
Luis Bunuel 's 1972 comedic look at stoicism , `` The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie , '' was revived as part of the Barbican 's Bunuel season .
Finally , Elovich created a one-man play , `` If Men Could Talk , the Stories They Would Tell , ''
about the attitudes andi emotional states of men facing death .
His play is a plea for men to escape the emotional ghetto of masculine stoicism .
