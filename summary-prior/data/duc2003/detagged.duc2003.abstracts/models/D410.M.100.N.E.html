The Schengen Accord , named for the town in Luxembourg where it was signed ,
is designed to abolish border controls
and speed up cross border traffic .
The accord is scheduled to go into effect in early 1994
but Great Britain , Ireland , and Denmark are resisting abolition of all border controls .
Great Britain , for example , wants to ensure
that unwanted non-EC travelers do not slip through the EC passport lane at ports and airports .
The Schengen Accord does commit member countries to abolish internal checks ,
but only
when sufficient measures , such as computer links between Schengen immigration authorities , have been put into place .
