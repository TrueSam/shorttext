Two incidents in California exemplify the controversy
that surrounds what is , or what appears to be , racial profiling .
A Hispanic motorist contended
that his arrest in the San Diego area was made because of his color , and not because he illegally passed another vehicle .
A Long Beach police officer arrested and manhandled a black man who was wearing dirty clothes and driving an old car .
The black man , a participant in a videotaped `` sting '' operation , claimed
that he was the victim of discrimination .
Customs officials along the United States-Mexican border have established profiles of smugglers that have led to arrests .
