Flooding in Mozambique in early 2000 killed at least 492 people .
One million people were left either homeless or in desperate need of help .
The floods caused an estimated $ 250 million in damage to roads , bridges , railways , and buildings .
Vast areas of agricultural land were destroyed ,
leading to acute hunger .
In some cases , water and farmlands were contaminated .
Many people needed medical attention .
Landmines from the two-decade civil war , which ended in 1992 , were displaced ;
large-scale de-mining and the rehabilitation of victims of war were expected to slow .
Mozambique 's growth rate , roughly 10 percent a year , was expected to fall because of the disaster .
