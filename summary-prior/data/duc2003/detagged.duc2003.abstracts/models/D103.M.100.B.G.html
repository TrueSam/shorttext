Hundreds of Web auction sites are online now
and are particularly successful in selling used goods .
A site called Internet Auction List
( www.internetauctionlist.com )
can give you an idea of exactly how many .
The mother of them all is Ebay .
It has hosted some 43 million auctions since it was founded in 1995 
and is raising $ 1.11 billion for international expansion in the selling of a huge range of goods . 
It has merged recently with Autotrader.com
to increase lucrative used auto sales and with Butterfield
to expand its auction of higher-end items .
Other fast-growing auctioneers are Amazon.com , Yahoo.com , Onsale Inc. and Auction Atlanta .
