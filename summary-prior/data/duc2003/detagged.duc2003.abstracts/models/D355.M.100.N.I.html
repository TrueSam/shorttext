Since the United States began a spaceborne ocean remote sensing program in 1978 , several other nations have launched
such programs and many otheri nations began receiving and analyzing the digital data from other nations ' satellites .
Orbiting sensors include Synthetic Aperture Radar
; multi-spectral electric self-spanning , visible and thermal infrared , and multi-channel microwave scanning radiometers ;
and ocean color monitors .
Information gathered includes water temperature ; currents ; mud , sand and chlorophyll concentrations ; red tide occurrences ; and other contaminations .
Data are used to predict worldwide weather ;
support the fishing , ocean transport , and petroleum industries ;
track environmental changes ;
and create general models of the ocean 's atmosphere system .
