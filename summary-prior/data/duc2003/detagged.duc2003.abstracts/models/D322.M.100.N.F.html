Increasing demand for artworks by known artists has sent prices soaring
and has opened an avenue for dishonest brokers and forgers .
The works of world famous artists such as Van Gogh , Renoir , Rembrandt , and many others have been copied and offered for sale as the real thing .
The Upstairs Gallery in Los Angeles was found to have over 1,600 forged lithographs .
A sculpture attributed to a 4th Century Greek master was found to be a copy only two years old .
Copies of ancient manuscripts have been produced on vellum , the material
on which the originals we printed .
