Many automobile accidents are recorded
in which the cause can not be explained .
After mechanical failure , bad weather conditions , and poor visibility are ruled out as causes ,
questions still remain .
The types of accidents
that fall into this category occur
when a car misses a curve or swerves suddenly
or crosses the highway median into oncoming traffic .
Alcohol has also been ruled out as a cause in most of these accidents .
One might suspect drowsiness or distraction
but , unfortunately , these cannot always be checked
since many of the accidents result in fatalities .
