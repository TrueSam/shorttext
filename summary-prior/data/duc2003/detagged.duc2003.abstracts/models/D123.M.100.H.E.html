Pilot training in flight schools is changing in various countries
as countries react to societal changes and world events .
In the U.S. the training of foreign pilots was called into question
as the State Department closed a California flight school for a brief period .
The U.S. Air force has contracted with a private contractor for its initial flight training
and the Navy is giving an introductory flight training course in an effort
to lower the drop out from its flight school .
In China , which has only one flight school , students can now get a private pilot 's license .
