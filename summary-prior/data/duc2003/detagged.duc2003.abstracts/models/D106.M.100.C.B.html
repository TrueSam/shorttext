The BCS system for selecting the two teams for college football 's national championship game uses more than just the two major polls .
The new system also factors in computer rankings , strength of schedule , and a team 's numberi of losses .
Champions from the Big East , Big Ten , Big 12 , SEC , Atlantic Coast , and Pac-10 conferences receive automatic bids to the BCS , which also includes two at-large teams .
The 1-2 teams in the BCS standings are matched in a national title game
that rotates among the Rose , Sugar , Orange , and Fiesta bowls .
Using a regional format , the other three bowls select the remaining conference champions and at-large teams .
