For years , Attorney General Janet Reno denied
that the FBI used incendiary devices during the final day of the siege on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco .
When the FBI admitted that it had fired incendiary tear gas grenades during the final assault on the compound ,
seemingly confirmed critics charges of a government cover up , the Attorney General named former Senator John Danforth to lead a probe into the government role in the incident .
A fire broke out during the assault and 80 Branch Davidians were killed either by the fire or from gunfire .
Danforth found that the government was not to blame for the fire or the deaths .
