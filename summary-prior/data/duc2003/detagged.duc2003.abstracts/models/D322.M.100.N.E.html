Art forgery is an international crime
that annually nets art dealers and forgers millions of dollars .
Individuals involved in the sale and trade of forgeries include Imelda Marcos of the Philippines as well as well known gallery owners such as Lee Sonnier and Frank de Marigny knowingly sold forgeries of every major artist ,
including Renoir , Rembraqndt , Picasso , Chagall , and Miro .
The forgeries were the work of such artists as Anthony Gene Tetro and Kea
ting ,
who turned out hundreds of paintings .
Art forgery has been a recurrent problem
and some forgers from the 19th and early 20th centuries were never unmasked in their life time .
