Ten French doctors founded Doctors Without Borders ( DWB )
in France in 1971 as Medecins Sans Frontieres .
They were disillusioned with the neutrality of the Red Cross ,
for whom they previously worked .
DWB sends volunteer medical personnel to some of the most destitute and dangerous parts of the world
and encourages them both to save lives
and to condemn the injustices they see .
They assert the right to intervene in any country
to treat the wounded , sick , and starving .
DOB has more than 2,000 physicians and medical personnel from 45 countries
who treat people in 80 countries ,
including 20 war zones .
