Space development blueprints include construction of a manned , earth-orbiting international space station and a Moon-based scientific station .
The space station would serve as a life-science laboratory and a base for planetary travel .
Experiments and tests on the space station would be used to demonstrate how long mankind can stay in space ,
assess long-term physical responses to low/micro gravity ,
and establish the methods to maintain health in space .
As colonization of the Moon is envisioned ,
propellants , supplies , and foods initially will be brought to the spaceport from Earth
and subsequently loaded on a vehicle to be transported to the Moon .
