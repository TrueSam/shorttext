Recently developed Alzheimer 's drugs such as piracetam , oxiracetam , tacrine , and physostigmine work
to inhibit an enzyme
that breaks down acetylcholine .
Tacrine ( Cognex ) is the first drug specifically approved in the US for the treatment of Alzheimer 's .
It eases symptoms ,
but does n't alter the underlying dementia process.i
Deprenyl citrate is claimed to delay the effects of Alzheimer 's .
Thirty to forty percent of patients may benefit from THA ,
but at best can expect only temporary improvement .
None of a new class of memory enhancing drugs called nootropics ,
even Aviva , can do more
than temporarily reverse or slow down mental degeneration .
