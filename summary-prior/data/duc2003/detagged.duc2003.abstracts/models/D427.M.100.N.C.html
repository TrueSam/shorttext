A decrease in stratospheric ozone
that naturally filters some of the sun 's ultraviolet ( UV ) rays 
will result in increased eye damage to unprotected people on earth .
We might expect eye cancer , age-related cataracts , age-related macular degeneration , cancer of the circumocular skin , pterygium and photokeratitis .
Children are particularly vulnerable
and damage is cumulative over a lifetime .
The best protection is UV blocking hats and sun glasses .
People with xeroderma pigmentosum must avoid sunlight otherwise
they run the risk of growths on the eyelids and cornea .
Eye cancer patients are being treated fairly successfully with ' proton therapy '
and cataracts are treated very successfully with surgery .
