Automobile recalls involving over 500,000 vehicles are not uncommon .
In March 1989 , for example , the EPA said
Ford would recall 513,000 cars
that exceeded federal emission standards .
Later that year , Ford announced another recall , nearly 1.3 million vehicles , again for violation of pollution control standards .
In 1990 , GM recalled 1.7 million cars with sticking throttles ,
Ford recalled 1.4 million cars with defective seats ,
and Chrysler recalled 500,000 vehicles with rusty front suspension parts .
A less typical recall is one by Mazda in 1990 .
The company recalled less than three thousand sports cars
because as many as three might have defective air bags .
