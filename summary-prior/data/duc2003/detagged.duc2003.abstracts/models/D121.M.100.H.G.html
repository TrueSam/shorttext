Interpol has been urging at its international conferences a new strategy to combat worldwide cross-border crime ,
primarily because of increasingly sophisticated crime syndicates .
The focus is on car thefts , smuggling , insurance fraud , child pornography , cross-border pollution , drug trafficking , and terrorism .
Increased cooperation is necessary in order to gather evidence for prosecution
and overcome obstacles in handing over terrorists .
China has made concerted efforts
to strengthen cooperation against organized crime , drugs , and terrorism especially with Hong Kong after the latter 's transition .
Interpol is also working with a US firm in developing a worldwide network system for early warning against cyber attacks .
