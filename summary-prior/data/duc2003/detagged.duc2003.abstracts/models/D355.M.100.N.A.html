Marine remote-sensing techniques date from the mid-1960 's .
The first integrated marine observation satellite , the SEASAT-A , was launched in 1978 .
Improved versions of its detectors , including Synthetic Aperture Radar
( SAR ) , are operational on the ERS-1 satellite
and are programmed for the Envosat-1 .
SAR provides imagery under all light and weather conditions .
The first ocean-color monitoring satellite , NIMBUS-7 , was launched in October 1978
and another is planned for 1994 .
Marine remote sensing techniques not only provide a rich source for meteorological and oceanographic research ,
but have practical applications in ocean petroleum development , location of marine products , marine engineering , ocean exploration and detection of water contamination .
