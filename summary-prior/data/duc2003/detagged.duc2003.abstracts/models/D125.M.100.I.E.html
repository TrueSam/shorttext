Neutrinos , sub-atomic particles
whose existence was postulated
long before their existence was confirmed , have been called Nature 's most elusive substance .
First predicted in the 1930s , the existence was first confirmed in 1951
when Dr. Frederick Reines and Dr. Clyde Cowan captured traces of their passing .
Study of the elusive particles continued from an observatory in Antarctica and from an abandoned mine in Japan .
The Japanese site , called the Super-Kamiokande detector ,
is located inside a mountain one mile underground .
Studying traces left by neutrinos
passing through a cathedral-sized tank of water ,
scientists were able to confirm
that neutrinos have mass .
