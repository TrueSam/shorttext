New research studies are providing valuable insight into the probable causes of schizophrenia .
Danish researchers have shown that family history as well as place ( urban areas ) and season of birth
( esp . February or March ) are the best predictors of the likelihood of schizophrenia .
Other research indicates a defect in the body 's olfactory system
-- probably a hereditary predisposition -- may contribute to schizophrenia .
There is also strong evidence that gene abnormalities on Chromosome 1 may cause schizophrenia .
Also evidenced is impairment of the brain 's cognitive function area and deficiencies in the thalamus .
Overall , research strongly links the development of schizophrenia to genetics .
