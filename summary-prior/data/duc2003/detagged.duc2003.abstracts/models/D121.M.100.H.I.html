The International Criminal Police Organization ( Interpol )
was created in 1923 .
Headquartered in France ,
its 177 members try to work together fighting crimes ,
holding frequent conferences ,
and sharing information and techniques .
Crimes that cross borders , including drug trafficking and smuggling , have long been targets .
Car thefts and smuggling along with insurance fraud have mushroomed in Europe with the end of the Cold War .
Europe is also concerned about sex crimes -- child pornography , pedophile tourism , prostitution rings , and human smuggling .
As criminals become more sophisticated , cooperation is being urged on terrorism , money laundering , and , most recently , cyberspace crimes .
