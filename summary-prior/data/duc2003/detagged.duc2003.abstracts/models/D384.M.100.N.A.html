Visionaries in the United States and abroad talk of constructing a space station as a first step towards colonizing the moon .
The major function of the station would be scientific and engineering research to determine how essential functions could be performed under conditions of low gravity and high radiation .
The next step would be a research station on the moon to further develop systems for production of food , water , construction materials and energy .
The difficulties in this challenge are staggering ,
but , undaunted , space scientists and engineers of the U.S. , Russia , Japan , Canada , and the European Space Association , working in concert ,
continue to refine plans towards this end .
