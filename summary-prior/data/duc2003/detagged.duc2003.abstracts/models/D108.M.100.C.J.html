Traditionally , Iowa 's precinct caucuses are the first Presidential delegate selection event ,
followed by the New Hampshire primary eight days later .
In 1999 Louisiana and South Carolina both announced
their primaries would be earlier in the year ,
forcing Iowa to hold its caucuses on Jan. 24 , 2000 and New Hampshire
to hold its first-in-the nation primary on Feb. 1 .
Additionally , politicos in New York and California recommended
changes in their state 's delegate selection processes .
Finally , the Supreme Court in June 2000 rejected California 's primary election system ,
forcing it , Washington State , and Alaska to change the way they conduct future primaries .
