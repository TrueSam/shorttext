The Los Angeles Times ( 1989-1990 ) reported the blood alcohol level ( BAL ) of the guilty drivers in sixteen fatal automobile accidents .
During this time the BAL set in California as legally proving drunkenness was lowered from .10 % to .08 % .
None of the accidents involved drivers with BAL below .10 % .
Six were at .20 % or higher .
The average BAL in ten one-fatality accidents was .193 % ,
while the average for two four-fatality accidents was .175 % .
These statistics prove nothing ,
but Municipal Judge John J. Hunter says that Athe higher a driver 's blood alcohol level , the higher the probability that death will result .
