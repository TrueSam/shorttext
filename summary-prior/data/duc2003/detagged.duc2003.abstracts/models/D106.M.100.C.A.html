The Bowl Championship Series ( BCS ) system for naming a national collegiate football champion is not perfect
but is an improvement over past systems .
BCS standings depend on : ranking in the AP and coaches ' poll ; computer rankings ; the strength of schedules ; and team records .
The two top teams compete for the championship in one of four bowl games with the site rotating from year to year .
Aside from disappointing TV ratings of the game , the system worked well in 1999 .
By July 2000 the Rose Bowl had tied down the championship games for 2002 and 2006 and $ 122 million for television rights from ABC .
