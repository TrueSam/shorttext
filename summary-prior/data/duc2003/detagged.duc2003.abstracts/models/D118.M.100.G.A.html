Attempts to assuage tribal conflict in African nations 1996-2000 were of limited success .
In 1996 Former President Nyerere of Tanzania called for thinking `` beyond tribal differences ''
and the U.S. promoted a response force to control tribal warfare in Burundi .
In 1997 and 1998 the U.S. interceded in a tribe-based struggle in Kenya and the U.N. formed a peacekeeping force to counter tribal tensions in the Central African Republic .
As troubles continued in Kenya in 1999 , President Moi called on Kenyans to scrap tribalism .
But by 2000 a South African minister said his country had `` not even begun to scratch the surface of black-on- black violence . ''
