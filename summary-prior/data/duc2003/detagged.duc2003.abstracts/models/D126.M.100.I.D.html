The eastern portion of the Northwest Territories was split off from the Northwest Territories to form Nunavut .
Inuits make up 85 % of the population .
It is one of the most remote and sparsely-settled-regions of the world .
Only 25,000 people live in its 77,000 square miles .
Snow , ice and tundra cover the Territory .
No roads connect the 26 isolated settlement .
