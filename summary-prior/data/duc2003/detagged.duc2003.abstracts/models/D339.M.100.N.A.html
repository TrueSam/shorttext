Cognex , the brand name for tacrine , is the first drug specifically approved in the U.S. for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease .
Manufactured by the U.S. pharmaceutical concern Warner Lambert ,
it is one of the new class of drugs called nootropics
which increase the amount of a neurotransmitter in the brain by inhibiting an enzyme which breaks down the neurotransmitter .
Cognex has been found to be effective in easing the symptoms in the mild-to-moderate stages of the disease ,
but there is no evidence that it alters the course of the underlying dementia process .
It does not prevent the build-up of tangled plaques which progressively destroy the patients ' brain .
