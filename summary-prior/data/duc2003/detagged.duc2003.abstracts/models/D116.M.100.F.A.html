In August 1999 the Kansas Board of Education voted 6-4 against new standards on science
drawn up by a committee of scientists ,
removing all mention of the big bang theory and the origin of the species .
Opponents thought the new standards hinted at teaching creationism in public schools ,
ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court .
In September 2000 a report to the American Association for the Advancement of Science gave grades to the 50 states on the teaching of evolution
and Kansas was lowest with an `` F- ''
-- even below Tennessee where Scopes was found guilty of teaching evolution 75 years before .
