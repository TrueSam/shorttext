The number of homeless in the U.S. is estimated as 500,000 to 600,000 .
Many die young and many are murdered .
Few cities are in a financial position to provide the basic needs :
affordable housing , addiction and medical treatment , and job training .
Some have used their police to forcibly move the homeless from place to place , including jail ,
thus shuffling the problem
rather than solving it .
Federal assistance is complicated by the difficulty of counting the homeless .
The problem of the homeless is so complex
that it may seem to defy solution ,
but one thing seems sure : affordable housing is the first step .
