Despite charges of fraud , eBay and other web site auctions on the internet continue to grow .
eBay downplays the amount of fraud in internet auctions
and guarantees purchases up to $ 200.00 .
Still , there have been questions raised
concerning the authenticity of one-of-a-kind sports memorabilia
being offered and some sellers have been successfully prosecuted .
eBay , founded in 1995 ,
has provided the model for others to follow
as it continues to expand its offerings ;
most recently offering used cars in an agreement with AutoTrader.com .
While safety appears to be a minor issue , the greatest threat to eBay and others is outages ,
which can affect the profits of buyer and seller alike .
