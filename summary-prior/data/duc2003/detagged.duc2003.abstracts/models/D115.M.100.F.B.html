The importance of the decennial census cannot be overstated in political terms .
Amidst lots of political squabbling , the House of Representatives sought summary judgment against the Commerce Department and the Bureau of the Census ( under the Democratic Clinton Administration ) over the proposed use of statistical sampling in the 2000 Census .
The Supreme Court , divided 5-4 , ruled that
the reapportionment of the 435 seats in the House of Representatives among the states must be based on raw , non-sampled data .
However , it left open the option for states to use statistically adjusted numbers for the purposes of redrawing political boundaries .
