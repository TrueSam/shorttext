Banks are using every tactic to fight
what was a popular consumer movement
to stop double charges for using another bank 's ATM .
Consumer advocates estimate the charge exacted by the ATM owner generates more than $ 2 billion in revenue for banks nationwide each year .
This charge was banned in Connecticut and Iowa , and eventually two California cities .
In New England , banks offered to limit charges in exchange for permission to merge .
Banks fought in the courts
saying they answered only to federal laws .
They cut-off , or threatened to cut-off , non-customer users .
National-level government actions were talked about
but never enacted .
